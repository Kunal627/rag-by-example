    "## Retrieval Strategies: Choosing the Right Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have embeddings and a vector store, the next step is **retrieval** — deciding how to fetch the most relevant information for a query. There are multiple retrieval strategies, each with its strengths and weaknesses. Choosing the right one depends on your data, the type of queries, and the application.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Dense Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**  \n",
    "Dense retrieval uses **embeddings** to represent text and queries as vectors in a high-dimensional space. Similarity metrics like cosine similarity or Euclidean distance are used to find the closest matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**  \n",
    "- Captures **semantic meaning** beyond exact keywords.  \n",
    "- Works well with **paraphrased queries** or loosely related text.  \n",
    "- Ideal for **knowledge retrieval** where context matters.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**  \n",
    "- Embedding generation can be **computationally expensive**.  \n",
    "- May require **GPU** for large datasets.  \n",
    "- Can sometimes miss **rare keyword-specific matches**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Use cases:**  \n",
    "- Retrieving recipe steps based on intent, e.g., “quick chocolate dessert.”  \n",
    "- Question-answering over unstructured text.  \n",
    "- Semantic search where users don’t know exact phrasing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Sparse Retrieval (Keyword-Based)\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**  \n",
    "Sparse retrieval uses traditional text-based methods like **BM25** or **TF-IDF**, which score documents based on keyword matches between the query and the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**  \n",
    "- Very **fast and lightweight**, can run on CPU.  \n",
    "- Effective for queries with **exact keywords**.  \n",
    "- Works well for **small to medium datasets**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**  \n",
    "- Does not understand **semantics or context**.  \n",
    "- Cannot match paraphrased queries well.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Use cases:**  \n",
    "- Searching for documents with specific ingredients, e.g., “vanilla extract.”  \n",
    "- Indexing structured documents where keywords are precise and consistent.  \n",
    "- Filtering large datasets quickly before semantic processing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Hybrid Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**  \n",
    "Hybrid retrieval combines **dense embeddings** and **sparse keyword matching**. Results from both methods are merged, often with weighting, to produce a ranked list of relevant documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**  \n",
    "- Balances **semantic understanding** with **exact matches**.  \n",
    "- Reduces chances of missing critical keyword-specific information.  \n",
    "- Can improve overall **retrieval accuracy**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**  \n",
    "- Slightly more complex to implement.  \n",
    "- Requires tuning of weights to balance dense vs sparse scores.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Use cases:**  \n",
    "- Large recipe PDFs where exact ingredient names are important but context also matters.  \n",
    "- QA systems where you need **precision + semantic recall**.  \n",
    "- Enterprise knowledge bases with mixed structured and unstructured content.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing the Right Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "| Strategy        | Best for                                                   | Notes                                         |\n",
    "|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| Dense           | Semantic search, paraphrased queries, context-rich data    | Slower, may need GPU, good for embeddings    |\n",
    "| Sparse          | Exact keyword match, structured data, fast retrieval      | Lightweight, but misses semantic matches     |\n",
    "| Hybrid          | Mixed requirements, both keywords and semantic meaning    | Offers best of both worlds, slightly complex |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key takeaway:**  \n",
    "- If your queries are **flexible and intent-driven**, use **dense retrieval**.  \n",
    "- If you need **exact matches or lightweight search**, use **sparse retrieval**.  \n",
    "- If you want **high accuracy across both semantics and keywords**, go **hybrid** — this is often the optimal choice for real-world applications like recipe PDFs or enterprise knowledge bases.\n"

Cutting the butter smaller will make it easier to mix. Step 2 Beat the butter at low speed for at least 5 minutes until it is light and fl uff y, has reached a much lighter color (near white) and has doubled in size. You can use a handheld beater, an electric mixer, or a food processor with a whisk attachment. Step 3 Add half of the sugar and mix it into the butter. You will be adding the rest of the sugar later; adding the sugar a small amount at a time will help prevent it from fl ying out everywhere. Step 4 Add the rest of the ingredients and continue mixing at a low speed. Adding only 1 teaspoon of milk or cream will make the frosting more stiff and is perfect for designing using a frosting tip but if you prefer a more loose and ‘spreadable’ butter cream you can opt for 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml). If you’re still uncer- tain with the amount of milk or cream to add, you can just add 1/2 a teaspoon fi rst to check. If you would like to make your buttercream less sweet, then add a pinch of salt. Step 5 Consider adding some coloring. You can leave the buttercream plain, or you can make it coloring by adding a few drops of food coloring or gel icing coloring. Keep in mind that some fl avorings, such as cocoa powder, will already tint the icing darker, so the coloring will not show up. Step 6 Add the rest of the sugar and beat the icing again using a high speed setting. This will give you frosting that is light and fl uff y.
