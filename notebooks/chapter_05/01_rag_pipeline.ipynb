    "### RAG Pipeline for Question Answering\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for Q&A, the process combines the strengths of information retrieval and large language models. First, a user question is taken as input and transformed into an embedding (dense vector) or keywords (sparse representation). Next, relevant documents or passages are retrieved from a knowledge base using similarity search. These retrieved chunks of information are then passed to the language model, which generates a final, context-aware answer. This approach ensures that responses are grounded in external knowledge, improving accuracy and reliability compared to relying on the model alone.\n",

    "   - Convert the query into a vector representation using an embedding model.\n",

    "   - Search the vector store (or BM25 for sparse retrieval) to fetch the most relevant document chunks.\n",

    "   - Collect and format the retrieved text passages to provide grounding for the model.\n",

Step 3 Mix the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, then slowly add the eggs with a little flour. Fold in the remaining flour, baking powder and bananas. Step 4 Pour into the tin and bake for about 30 mins until a skewer comes out clean. Cool in the tin for 10 mins, then remove to a wire rack. Step 5 Optional: Mix the icing sugar with 2-3 tsp water to make a runny icing. Drizzle the icing across the top of the cake and decorate with banana chips.

Step 3 Stir in ground almonds. Add half the fl our and half the milk. Use a wooden spoon to stir until well combined. Repeat remaining fl our and milk. Step 4 Arrange the apple, slightly overlapping, over the base of the prepared tin. Spoon mixture into the tin and smooth the surface. Step 5 Bake in the oven for 30-35 mins or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Step 6 Set aside in the pan for 10 mins to cool slightly before turning onto a serving plate.

      " COCONUT CREAM CAKE PREP:  1:25  MINS COOK TIME:  40  MINS TOTAL TIME:  2:05  MINS Directions Step 1 Prepare Filling: Whisk together fi rst 3 ingredients in a heavy saucepan. Whisk egg yolks and next 2 ingredients in a glass bowl. Gradually whisk egg mixture into sugar mixture. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, 6 to 7 minutes or until mixture just starts to bubble. Cook, whisking constantly, 1more minute; remove from heat. Step 2 Whisk fl aked coconut and next 3 ingredients into sugar-egg mixture; transfer to a medium bowl. Place plastic wrap directly on warm fi lling to prevent fi lm from forming. Let stand 30 minutes; chill 4 to 24 hours. Step 3 Meanwhile, prepare Cake Layers: Preheat oven to 350°. Beat 1 cup butter at medium speed with a heavy-duty electric stand mixer until creamy. Gradu- ally add 2 cups sugar, beating until light and fl uff y. Add 4 eggs, 1 at a time, beating just until blended after each addition. Step 4 Stir together cake fl our and next 2 ingredients in a bowl. Stir together milk and 1/2 cup coconut milk in a measuring cup. Add fl our mixture to butter mixture alternately with milk mixture, beginning and ending with fl our mixture. Beat at low speed just until blended after each addition. Stir in 1 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp.coconut extract. Spoon batter into 2 greased (with shortening) and fl oured 9-inch cake pans. Step 5 Bake at 350° for 25 to 30 minutes or until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool in pans on wire racks 10 minutes. Remove from pans to wire racks, and cool completely (about 1 hour). Step 6 Beat 1 cup heavy cream at high speed with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form. Gently fold whipped cream into chilled Filling. Step 7 Assemble cake: Split each layer in half horizontally with a serrated knife to make 4 layers. Place 1 layer, cut side up, on a serving platter; spread with 1 1/3 cups Filling. Repeat with remaining Cake Layers and Filling, ending with a Cake Layer, cut side down.
