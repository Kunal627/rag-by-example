        "content": "1 teaspoon (5 mL) lemon juice Directions Ingredients: Step 1 Sift the Icing Sugar into a bowl. Sifting is not necessary but will help keep your icing from getting lumpy. Step 2 Separate the egg whites into a separate bowl. Crack an egg and then turn it crack-side up. As you gently open it, use half of the shell to catch the yolk. Allow white to drain by transferring yolk from one half of the shell to the other several times. Step 3 Combine lemon juice and egg whites and mix briefl y with a wire whisk. You don’t have to whisk much or for long. Whisking for 20 seconds will help break up the egg whites and combine it with the lemon juice. Step 4 In a stand mixer, combine the lemon juice and egg white mixture with the sugar, adding the sugar a little at a time. Start with 1 1/2 cups or 2 cups of sugar, and gradually add the rest while the mixer is on its medium setting. Mix until shiny and opaque, about 5 minutes.Hand mixers also do the trick just fi ne if you do not have a stand mixer. In a pinch, a little bit of old-fashioned hard work will work as well, although you’ll be getting a considerable workout. Step 5 For icing to be used as piping, mix the royal icing until soft peaks begin forming. Soft peaks are contoured without being fi rm; when you dip your whisk into the icing and turn it upside down, the peaks move back in on themselves.[1] 3 cups (330 grams) icing sugar, plus additional as necessary 2 egg whites Step 6 Continue mixing and adding sugar, 2 teaspoons at a time, for fi rmer peaks. If you want fi rm peaks for your icing, continue adding sugar a little bit at a time while the mixer is still beating. The additional sugar will create a stiff er icing. Step 7 Adjust as necessary with sugar, water, or egg whites. You probably have a good idea of how you want your icing to turn out. However, sometimes, things don’t happen according to plan. If you need to change the consistency of your icing — it’s too stiff , for example — don’t fret. Here’s how you adjust the consistency of your icing: a. If your icing is too runny, add more sugar. A little bit at a time works best. b. If your icing is too stiff , add  more egg white. Again, a little goes a long way. c. If you want to runny icing, add water, a couple drops at a time, to the icing. [2] Whisk the icing and wait for the peaks to break up. Since this process causes air-bubbles to form, rest runny icing for up to 30 minutes before using to allow time for the air bubbles to dissipate. d. Use royal icing immediately or transfer to an airtight container. Royal icing hardens very quickly if not properly stored. PREP:  215  MINS TOTAL TIME:  15  MINS YIELD:  20  CUPS ",

        "name": " BUTTERCREAM ICING",
        "content": "1 – 2 tablespoons tin milk Pinch of salt (optional) Directions Ingredients: Step 1 Cut softened butter into cubes and put it into a bowl. Cutting the butter smaller will make it easier to mix. Step 2 Beat the butter at low speed for at least 5 minutes until it is light and fl uff y, has reached a much lighter color (near white) and has doubled in size. You can use a handheld beater, an electric mixer, or a food processor with a whisk attachment. Step 3 Add half of the sugar and mix it into the butter. You will be adding the rest of the sugar later; adding the sugar a small amount at a time will help prevent it from fl ying out everywhere. Step 4 Add the rest of the ingredients and continue mixing at a low speed. Adding only 1 teaspoon of milk or cream will make the frosting more stiff and is perfect for designing using a frosting tip but if you prefer a more loose and ‘spreadable’ butter cream you can opt for 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml). If you’re still uncer- tain with the amount of milk or cream to add, you can just add 1/2 a teaspoon fi rst to check. If you would like to make your buttercream less sweet, then add a pinch of salt. 3 cups (375grams) icing sugar 1 cup (225 grams) unsalted butter 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional) Step 5 Consider adding some coloring. You can leave the buttercream plain, or you can make it coloring by adding a few drops of food coloring or gel icing coloring. Keep in mind that some fl avorings, such as cocoa powder, will already tint the icing darker, so the coloring will not show up. Step 6 Add the rest of the sugar and beat the icing again using a high speed setting. This will give you frosting that is light and fl uff y. You will need to beat it for about two to three minutes. a. If the cream is too thick, add some more cream, milk, or half-and-half. Start with one tablespoon, mix, then add more if necessary. b. If the cream is too thin, add a little bit more confec tioner’s sugar Step 7 Store or serve the buttercream. At this point, you can spread the buttercream over a cake or some cupcakes, or you can store it in a plastic Ziploc bag or an airtight container until you are ready to use it. a. Buttercream will stay fresh in the refrigerator for 2 weeks b. Cakes and cupcakes frosted with buttercream will stay fresh for 3 days. PREP:  15  MINS TOTAL TIME:  15  MINS YIELD:  6  CUPS ",

Sprinkle the gelatin over cold water in a small bowl and let it rest for two minutes to soften. Place the bowl in a microwave for 30 seconds on high, until the gelatin dissolves. Step 2 Add the almond extract, corn syrup and glycerin. Add these ingredients to the gelatin mixture and stir until smooth and clear. If the mixture is not turning smooth and clear, microwave it for an additional 15 to 20 seconds on high and stir again. Step 3 Add the sugar. Sift 1-1/2 lbs of the sugar into a mixing bowl. Make a hole in the center of the sugar and stir the liquid mixture into it. Stir with a wooden spoon until the mixture becomes sticky. Then add the food coloring. 1 tablespoon (9.25 grams) gelatin ¼ cup cold water 1 teaspoon almond extract ½ cup light corn syrup 1 tablespoon (1.26 grams) glycerin Step 4 Prepare your work surface. Sift some of the remaining 1/2 pound of sugar onto a clean work surface. Any leftover sugar can be added back into the fondant mixture, as needed. Step 5 Knead the fondant. Turn the fondant onto the powdered work surface and knead until it forms a smooth, pliable mass, adding more sugar if necessary. Rub the vegetable shortening onto your fi ngers and continue to knead the fondant, working the shortening in. Step 6 Wrap the fondant in plastic wrap. Place the wrapped fondant in a tightly sealed container to stop it from drying out. The fondant will last for approximately six days, if kept in the refrigerator.
