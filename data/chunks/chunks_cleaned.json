The temperature of butter can dramatically affect the texture of baked goods. There are three different stages of butter that is typically called for: softened, chilled (or frozen like in scones), and melted and cooled. Room temperature (20 to 25 °C) butter is often beaten with sugar, either granulated or brown, into a light and airy creamed texture. This helps leaven the baked item and creates a more tender texture. Butter that has been partially softened in the microwave will, more often than not, yield a greasy baked good.
