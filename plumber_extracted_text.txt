HISTORY
01. The saying “You can’t have your cake and eat it” (-originally “a man cannot have his
cake and eat his cake”) is first recorded in a letter on 14 March 1538 from Thom-
as, Duke of Norfolk, to Thomas Cromwell
02. The proverb ‘a piece of cake’ was not coined until the 20th century.
03. The word ‘cake’ comes from Middle English kake, and is probably a borrowing
from Old Norse.
04. The meaning of ‘cake’ has changed over time, and the first cake was:
A comparatively small flattened sort of bread, round, oval, or otherwise
regularly shaped, and usually baked hard on both sides by being turned
during the process.
07
--- Page 9 ---
05. In Scotland, and parts of Wales and northern England, cake took on the
specific meaning of ‘a thick, hard biscuit made from oatmeal’.
06. The first birthday cake was originally a cake given as an offering on a person’s
birthday. The first reference to ‘birthday cake’ came in 1785.
07. During the 17th century, in England, people believed that keeping fruitcakes
under the pillow of those who are unmarried will give them sweet dreams
about their fiancee.
09. The world’s tallest cake stood 10. The world’s largest wedding

11. The world’s most expensive cake, christened the “Pirates Fantasy,” cost a
whopping $35 million. Crafted by Chef D.K., Group Skills Development Chef
at Aitken Spence Hotels. It was adorned with ten different stones belonging
to the sapphire family with the most expensive and the rarest one being a
“Padmaraja” or the ‘King Sapphire.” It also included ten pieces of jewelry
ranging from necklaces, bracelets, rings, brooches pendants, tie pins,

10 BAKING
TIPS
Always have the correct 01.
consistency of butter.
a. Butter is the starting point for an immense amount of baked goods, so it’s important to
have it prepped as the recipe suggests. The temperature of butter can dramatically
affect the texture of baked goods. There are three different stages of butter that is
typically called for: softened, chilled (or frozen like in scones), and melted and cooled.
b. Room temperature (20 to 25 °C) butter is often beaten with sugar, either granulated or
brown, into a light and airy creamed texture. This helps leaven the baked item and
creates a more tender texture.
c. Butter that has been partially softened in the microwave will, more often than not,
yield a greasy baked good. Always leave it out on the counter for around 1 hour to
yield the perfect consistency.
d. Softened butter should give slightly when pressed but still hold its shape. Chilled butter
is well chilled in the refrigerator or freezer so that it does not melt during mixing.
e. Melted and cooled butter should be liquefied and lukewarm. If melted butter is too
hot, it can cook the batter and eggs.
62
POT
--- Page 64 ---
02.
Room Temperature is KEY
Speaking of temperature, if a recipe calls for room temperature eggs or any dairy
ingredients such as milk or yogurt, make sure you follow suit. Recipes don’t just do that
for fun– room temperature ingredients emulsify so much easier into batter creating a
uniform structure and texture throughout your baked good. Think of rock hard
butter– it’s not so easy to cream that into a soft consistency is it? Same goes for
eggs, especially the egg whites. They give so much more volume to the batter
at room temperature. So yes, temperature is imperative!
03. Always read the recipe in full
before beginning.
In order to avoid a complete and total disaster in the kitchen simply because you didn’t
realize a certain step was coming up, read ahead to know the how, why, where, and
when of what you are about to do. It will take you 1-5 minutes max and could save you
from wasting your ingredients on a failed dessert.
63

prepared.
BEFORE beginning a recipe. So, read through the ingredients, get them prepared and
ready on your counter, then read the recipe in full. There is very little room for error
when you begin recipes this way. Trust me, trust me, trust me.

Learn how to measure.

This means that you should use a spoon to on measuring ingredients properly.
64
--- Page 66 ---
06.
Weigh your ingredients.
I own a small kitchen scale and it is, by far, the most used tool in my kitchen.
A gram or ounce is always a gram or an ounce. But a cup isn’t always a cup. This is
why I offer gram measurements with my recipes. Again, precision is everything.
07.
Get an oven thermometer!
a. Unless you have a brand new or regularly calibrated oven, your oven’s temperature is
likely inaccurate. When you set your oven to 350°F, it might not really be 350°F inside.
It could only be off by a little – 10 degrees or so. Or more than that – 100 degrees or
even more!
b. Do you know what that will do to your cookies, cinnamon rolls, and cakes? While this
might not seem like a big deal to you, it is a LOADED problem for baked goods.
As you know, when it comes to baking, accuracy is everything; there is little room for error.
c. Having an oven whose temperature is off can ruin your baked goods, the hours spent on
the recipe, the money spent on ingredients, and leave you hungry for dessert.
The inexpensive remedy to these baking disasters is an oven thermometer. While cheap,
they’re irreplaceable in a baker’s kitchen. Place it in your oven so you always
know the actual temperature.
65
--- Page 67 ---
08.
Keep your oven door closed
a. You now know how the oven’s temperature can ruin a recipe. But what can completely
throw off the oven temperature is constantly opening and closing that oven to peek at
your baking cupcakes.
b. I mean, I get it. It’s tempting to keep the oven door ajar to see your cake rising, the
cookies baking, and the cupcakes puffi ng up! But doing so can let cool air in, which
greatly interrupts your baked good from cooking. Or worse– affects how your
baked good is rising.
c. If you need to test your cakes for doneness with a toothpick, do so quickly. Remove it
from the oven, close the oven immediately, test for doneness, put it back in as
quickly as you can if more bake time is required.
66
--- Page 68 ---
09.
Chill your cookie dough.
a. If the recipe calls for it OR if you fi nd the cookie dough incredibly sticky and soft OR if
you want to bake the cookies at a later time. Chilling fi rms up cookie dough, decreasing
the possibility of spreading.
b. Chilling cookie dough not only ensures a thicker, more solid cookie but an accentuated
flavor. In chocolate chip cookies, for example,
it helps develops a heightened buttery, caramel-y flavor.
c. After chilling, let your cookie dough sit at room temperature for about 10 minutes (or
more, depending how long the dough has chilled) before rolling into balls and baking.
d. Alternatively, sometimes I chill the cookie dough for 2 hours, roll into balls, and then chill
the balls on a paper plate for 1 day. The cookie dough is quite hard after being chilled
after the 6-8 hour mark, so that way is a little easier.
67
--- Page 69 ---
10.
Cookie Trick!
a. Last one! It’s about cookies. To keep leftover cookies extra soft, store them with a piece of
bread. Have you heard this before?
Maybe you have, maybe you haven’t. If storing cookies in a Tupperware or cookie jar, stick
a regular piece of bread in there as well.
b. The bread will give out all its moisture and dry up while the cookies will stay moist, soft,
and tender. It’s the BEST TRICK EVER.

Icing Sugar
No cake would be complete without using icing sugar,
which can also be used to make goodies such as
shortbread, cream fi llings, marshmallow, and
fondant; anywhere a smooth, soft fi nished texture
is required.
It contains a small amount of anti-caking agent
(cornstarch) to prevent clumping and improve flow.
Its fi ne texture makes icing sugar ideal for dusting
over cakes, pies and pastries to sweeten as well as to
add an attractive decorative touch.
It can be used for all types of Icings and Frostings.
Food Color
Used for food coloring
69
--- Page 71 ---
Cocoa Powder
1. Makes food chocolaty and delicious.
2. The acidic (non-alkaline) properties of natural
cocoa powder will counterbalance the alkaline
of the baking soda.
3. Dutch-process cocoa, on the other hand, is
treated with alkaline, which makes it taste less
bitter and powerful. Dutch-process cocoa often
has a darker, redder color compared to natural
cocoa powder. (4)
Glucose
Liquid glucose, or sugar syrup, is used to impart
extra moisture and softness to products such as
cakes, and also used for ease of handling in icings
or frostings. In cakes, sugar syrup is usually added
during the creaming stage with sugar and butter.
When sugar syrup is utilized in royal icing or frosting,
the syrup serves the purpose of preventing
hardening and improving viscosity of the frosting.
More specifi cally, sugar gives cookies their crisp
texture and assists in spread. In breads or rolls,
sugar not only gives fl avor but aids in crumb color,
grain texture, and volume.
Furthermore, all products able to form a crust utilize
sugar in a chemical reaction called a Maillard
reaction, where proteins and sugars react to
enhance crust color and flavor.

Brown Sugar
Brown sugar is used very similarly to granulated
white sugar but it provides a touch of extra flavor.
Common uses for brown sugar include sweetening
baked goods, beverages, sauces, and marinades.
Some varieties of natural brown sugar are also used
to make alcoholic beverages like rum.
Carboxy Methyl Cellulose (CMC)
CMC is used in baking for its thickening and
stabilizing properties. In desserts:
CMC is used to thicken sauces and bind water.
In Cakes: CMC is used to trap air bubbles, helping the
batter retain air for volume and fi ne grain.
It also helps retain moisture for
extended shelf-life.
72

Corn Flour
Corn starch has double the thickening power than
that of flour.
It needs to be included in portions half in
size as flour.
It is an anti-caking agent & as a thickening agent.
It increase the tenderness of the grain, to give the
baked item greater crumbstrength.
It an ideal thickening agent in baked items when no
additional colour changes or fl avour additives
are desired.
Bicarbonate Of Soda (BOS)
In cakes, cookies, biscuits, crackers, and quick breads,
baking soda is used to produce carbon dioxide gas.
The carbon dioxide helps to make the cake mixture
rise, so that the cakes are light and fluffy.

this by off ering something unique. However,
though innovation will get you noticed, quality
will remain key to a sustainable business, it is
of great importance that beginners therefore
invest in training. You also need to study
the cake industry to know how to carve a niche
for your brand and fi gure out why
your existing customers choose you

Baking may be regarded as a science,
but it’s the chemistry between the ingredients
and the cook that gives desserts life.
Baking is done out of love, to share with family and friends,
to see them smile.
