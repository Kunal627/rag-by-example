## How to Use

- Each chapter has a **notebook** with explanations + code
- Follow in order for a progressive learning path
- Reusable Python scripts live in `common/`

**Caveat**:
This chatbot is a **learning project only** and is **not production-ready**. The objective of this tutorial is to build intuition on RAGS and to give enough hands on experience to learners.
